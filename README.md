# This program aims to combat the poor search feature of facebook marketplace which only allows one location to be searched at a time.
#
# The program searches every location specified in the config file and opens them in separate tabs for easy viewing of your specified item.
#
# For best results set search radius to the maximum amount on facebook.
#
# Please note that locations are abbreviated differently, for example "Los Angeles" is defined as "la" in the marketplace url.
# You may need to check before updating the config file.
